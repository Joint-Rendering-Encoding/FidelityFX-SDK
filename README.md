## Overview of TransparentSR

TransparentSR is a library that enables decoupling video upscalers (aka super-resolution (SR) models) from game renderers, which allows utilizing
various upscalers with games _without_ changing their source code.

The following figure presents a high-level illustration of TransparentSR. 

XXXX, it will be good if you include an overview figure (maybe similar to the one you developed before). the figure should have clearly show the possibility of using multiple SR models. XXX


The details of TransparentSR are published in the following paper: 

* Deniz Ugur, Ihab Amer, and Mohamed Hefeeda, **Decoupling Video Upscaling from Rendering for Cloud Gaming**, In Proc. of ACM Multimedia Systems (MMSys'25) Conference, Stellenbosch, South Africa, March 2025. 

The **abstract** of the paper is below: 

Many recent video games require powerful hardware to render them. To reduce such high hardware requirements, upscalers have been proposed in the literature and industry. Upscalers save computing resources by first rendering games at lower resolutions and frame rates and then upscaling them to improve playersâ€™ quality of experience. Current upscalers, however, are tightly coupled with the rendering logic of video games, which requires updating
the source code of each game for every upscaler. This increases the development cost and limits the use of upscalers. The tight coupling also stifles the deployment of upscalers in cloud gaming platforms to reduce the required computing resources. We propose decoupling upscalers from game renderers, which allows utilizing various upscalers with games without changing their source code. It also accelerates deploying upscalers in cloud gaming. Decoupling upscalers from renderers is, however, challenging because of the diversity of upscalers, their dependency on information at different rendering stages, and the strict timing requirements of video games. We present an efficient solution that addresses these challenges. We implement the proposed solution and demonstrate its effectiveness with two popular upscalers. We also develop a cloud gaming system in the emerging Media-over-QUIC (MoQ) protocol and implement the proposed approach with it. Our experiments show the potential savings in computing resources while meeting the strict timing constraints of video games.

## Implementation of TransparentSR

TransparentSR is implemented based on XXX  It consists of XXXX .. provide some details on the overall architecture, source code structure, etc.   It is OK to say we start from FSR SDK. but describe TransparentSR as a library that can be used without going back to FSR or DLSS. XXX


Although there are [many changes](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK/compare/release-FSR3-3.0.4...DenizUgur:Detached-FSR-DLSS:fsr-dlss-remote) in this repository, the key feature is encapsulated in the [`TransparentSR`](framework/cauldron/framework/libs/tsr/) library. This library is responsible for managing the detachment of resources needed for upscaling. It can be used with any upscaler, not just FSR or DLSS.


## Sample Upscalers: AMD FSR and NVIDIA DLSS 

TransparentSR can easily support various video upscalers. To demonstrate its functionality, we have tested it with two of the most widely deployed upscalers: AMD FSR and NVIDIA DLSS. 


### Building and Testing Sample Upscalers

XXX restructure your write-up below to show exactly how we build and test TransparentSR for FSR and DLSS. Do not keep referring to FSR and DLSS websites. Maybe once or so. Describe TransparentSR as independent as possible XXXX 


This repository showcases a [sample](./samples/fsr/) implementation of the Detached FSR/DLSS Framework. It is possible to run the sample without detaching the upscaler as well. 


 ## How to build the sample

Building the sample is exactly the same as building the FidelityFX SDK. You can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK/blob/release-FSR3-3.0.4/docs/getting-started/building-samples.md). Be sure to build "Native-backed DLL" version.

To build our modified sample you should follow these instructions:

1. Install the following software developer tool minimum versions:

-   [CMake 3.17](https://cmake.org/download/)
-   [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
-   [Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
-   [Vulkan SDK 1.3.239](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) (Not used in the sample, but required for the FidelityFX SDK)

2. Generate Visual Studio FSR sample solutions:

**Native-backend DLL version**

```bash
> <installation path>\BuildFSRSolutionNativeDll.bat
```

This will generate a `build\` directory where you will find the solution for either the native-backend-backed SDK samples (`FidelityFX SDK Native.sln`).

Also be sure to download media files using the following command:

```bash
> <installation path>\UpdateMedia.bat
```

> More information about this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK/blob/release-FSR3-3.0.4/docs/tools/media-delivery.md).

### A note on the sample

Detaching the upscaler from the rendering process requires both process to be in sync. To account for scheduling issues and not to drop any rendered frames, both processes will wait for each other to fill/empty the resource pool. The resource pool is a static pool of 10 buffers. Each buffer has enough space for all the required resources for both FSR and DLSS to function.

> It is possible to optimize this aspect by using a dynamic resource pool. This will allow the upscaler to run at a different rate than the renderer. However, at this time this sample is no more than a proof of concept.

### How to run the sample

Since we deploy two seperate processes for the upscaling and rendering, it becomes difficult to run it within the Visual Studio IDE. We recommend building the solution and the use the helper CLI tool ([governor](./governor.py)) to run the sample.

1. Build the solution using the instructions above.
2. Run the sample using the following command:

```bash
# Display help
python governor.py -h

# Example usage
python governor.py --render-res 1285 835 --upscaler FSR3

# Example usage without detaching the upscaler
python governor.py --render-res 1285 835 --upscaler FSR3 --use-default

# Example usage if you want to launch the upscaler from Visual Studio
python governor.py --render-res 1285 835 --upscaler FSR3 --skip-upscaler # This will skip launching the upscaler
```

## Current Approaches for Integrating Upscalers with Video Games

Current approaches in the literature and industry require changing the source code of each game for every single upscaler, which is unlike TransparentSR, which reduces integration efforts and costs by transparently supporting various upscalers with minimal/no changes in the game source code. 

For example, the following sites explain the detailed (and different) integration steps of two common upscalers:

-   [FSR (FidelityFX SDK)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK/blob/55ff22bb6981a9b9c087b9465101769fc0acd447/readme.md)
-   [DLSS (Streamline SDK)](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Streamline/blob/c709dd9874e21dea100d6e2f2e109d16b87b8b55/README.md)



## Reproducing the Results in the MMSys'25 Paper 

XXX describe: we have various results. one for FSR and DLSS. another from MoQ. 

Describe them in a way that enables people to reproduce them. Share the scripts and datasets. As much as you can. 


### Evaluation of Individual Gaming Stations (Sec 4.3) 
XXX 

## Evaluation in Cloud Gaming 

Describe MoQ and how we can obtain the results 

Streaming of the upscaled content is done using [Media-over-QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/). The sample and the governor script can be configured to stream the upscaled content locally. This is done by setting the `--stream` flag in the governor script.

### Prerequisites

The version numbers are the ones used during the development of the sample. It is possible to use newer versions of the software.

-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (1.81.0)
-   [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) (1.23.1)
-   [Clang](https://chocolatey.org/packages/llvm) (18.1.8)
-   [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (7.0.2)

### Setup

Run the convenience script to setup the MOQ server:

```bash
.\SetupMOQ.bat
```

### Running the sample

The sample's configuration must be set to stream the content. Please refer to the [governor](./governor.py) script for more information. To run the sample with streaming enabled, use the following command:

```bash
python governor.py --render-res 1285 835 --upscaler FSR3 --stream
```

> There's no restriction on which parameters can be used with the `--stream` flag.

### Viewing the stream

This repository includes a simple web page to view the stream. Checkout the `demo/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

> This server will be launched if you use the `--stream` flag in the governor script.

Or if you want to quickly verify the stream, you can visit the following URL:

```bash
https://quic.video/watch/live?server=localhost:4443
```

and view the stream.

> Warning: If you encounter TLS errors, please make sure to run the `SetupMOQ.bat` script again.
